  <p>If merchandise is later exchanged for another piece of merchandise, any VIPeak Points previously earned will be adjusted to reflect the VIPeak Points that would have been earned if the merchandise received via exchange was originally purchased and the Member’s account adjusted accordingly. Please allow 1-10 days for this adjustment to be reflected in your online VIPeak account.</p>
  <p>No VIPeak Points will be earned on the purchase of The Alpine-branded items sold at wholesalers or at third party retailers.</p>
<h3>5.     Earning Points Via Activity. </h3>
<p>Restrictions are provided for illustrative purposes only.

By way of example only, for “Refer A Friend,” such restrictions include persons who count as a “friend.”</p>
<p>A maximum of one-hundred (100) VIPeak Points may be earned by a given Member per year via activities other than merchandise purchase. </p>
<p>VIPeak Points earned via activities other than merchandise purchase are valid for one (1) year from date of issuance.</p>
<h3>6.    Rewards.</h3>
